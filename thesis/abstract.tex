Frequent Itemset Mining with tidyclust in R\par

Unsupervised learning is closely associated with clustering, however other methodss
fall under this umbrella such as data mining. In R, the \textbf{tidyclust} package provides a 
unified interface for clustering models, yet lacks support for data mining. This 
thesis addresses this gap by introducing the Apriori and ECLAT algorithms into tidyclust, 
with a focus on frequent itemset mining. Unlike traditional clustering models, frequent 
itemsets produce groupings of column variables, rather than cluster labels or partitions 
of observations. To address this, a novel clustering approach is proposed: items (columns) 
are grouped based on their ”dominant” frequent itemset. A key contribution is a new
prediction method, modeled as a recommender system, to predict missing items. This 
implementation extends tidyclust to support column-based clustering, with applications 
in market basket analysis and recommender systems.
