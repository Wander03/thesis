ABSTRACT \\
Frequent Itemset Mining with tidyclust in R

Clustering is a core technique in unsupervised learning, allowing for the discovery of patterns
in unlabeled data. In R, the tidyclust package provides a unified interface for clustering
models, yet lacks support for data mining. This thesis addresses this gap by introducing
the Apriori and ECLAT algorithms into tidyclust, with a focus on frequent itemset mining.
Unlike traditional clustering models, frequent itemsets do not inherently produce cluster
labels. To address this, a novel clustering approach is proposed: items (columns) are
grouped based on their ”dominant” frequent itemset. A key contribution is a new prediction
method, modeled as a recommender system, to predict missing items. This implementation
extends tidyclust to support column-based clustering, with applications in market basket
analysis and recommendation systems.
